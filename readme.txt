Allows you to take complete control of your admin area's content by restricting access to admin menus, submenus, posttypes to specific user or specific user roles.

== Description ==

User Rights Access Manager is a lightweight and powerful plugin that grants you complete control on your admin area's content by restricting access of admin menus, submenus, post-types to specific user or specific user roles.

This plugin allows you to set limited access on your admin area's content for logged in users.

You’ll find it quite simple to restrict entire posts, pages or custom post types or just portions of them.

It will work for both, 
-Roles & 
-Users

This plugin will prove to be helpful for sites having multiple users and when the admin wants to levy certain restriction on certain users depending upon various criteria.

There are 2 ways to limit access - Namely:

**Role wise** - used to limit access of all users having same role.

**User wise** - used to limit access of a particular user.

A User wise restriction can override settings of role wise restriction.
